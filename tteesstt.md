# Big Data Mining Assignment: Create Your Own Noisy Dataset

## Overview
This project aims to simulate a real-world dataset with added noise and missing values. It helps understand the challenges of working with imperfect data and showcases practical Python programming skills in generating and manipulating datasets.
This Jupyter Notebook, "Big_Data_M.ipynb" is designed for analyzing and processing large-scale data. It primarily contains code cells, with outputs generated from the computations.
The dataset focuses on including attributes such as demographics, travel preferences, booking details, and cost. The deliverables include a reproducible Python process for generating the data and adding noise.

## Features
1. **Automated Data Generation**: Uses Python libraries (`pandas`, `numpy`, `faker`, `datetime`) to generate realistic synthetic data.
2. **Noise and Missing Values**:
   - Random noise is added to numerical and categorical fields.
   - Missing values are introduced to simulate incomplete data.
3. **Reproducibility**: Clear, modular code ensures anyone can replicate the dataset generation.

## Files Included
- `Big_Data_M.ipynb`.
- `requirements.txt`.

## Installation and Setup

Instructions:
1. Save the Jupyter Notebook "Big_Data_M.ipynb " in your pc (at the same path these csv files will produced).
2. Open the notebook using Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment (e.g., JupyterLab, VS Code with a Python extension).
3. Run the whole code included at the Notebook all at once to reproduce the results. 
4. Two new csv files will be created at the same dierectory where "Big_Data_M.ipynb " was saved. 
5. If data files or external dependencies are required, ensure they are accessible in the same directory or update the file paths accordingly.

### Installation Steps

Dependencies:
The notebook might rely on specific Python libraries. Please install the following dependencies if not already present:
- Required libraries (based on typical big data projects): pandas, numpy, matplotlib, datetime, Faker.

To set up the environment, install the required Python packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
